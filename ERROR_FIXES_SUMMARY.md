- **Result**: Proper ES6 module resolution

### 4. Code Quality Issues
- **Fixed**: Duplicate handleLogout function in Admin/Dashboard.tsx
- **Fixed**: Type safety issues in Terminal.tsx skillCategories access
- **Fixed**: Error handling type safety (unknown error type)
- **Fixed**: useEffect dependency warning in ContentManager.tsx

### 5. Package Configuration
- **Fixed**: Inconsistent package.json files between root, client, and server
- **Fixed**: Missing dependencies and version mismatches
- **Fixed**: Updated React Scripts version for better compatibility

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- All TypeScript files compile without errors
- All React components properly typed
- Theme system fully functional
- Build process successful
- Security vulnerabilities significantly reduced

### ⚠️ Remaining Issues
- 12 npm vulnerabilities in client dependencies (6 moderate, 6 high)
  - These are mostly transitive dependencies from react-scripts
  - Can be addressed with `npm audit fix --force` but may cause breaking changes
  - Consider upgrading to newer React version in future

## 🛠️ Files Modified

### Configuration Files
- `client/tsconfig.json` (created)
- `client/src/styled.d.ts` (created)
- `client/package.json` (dependencies updated)
- `server/package.json` (dependencies updated)
- `package.json` (dependencies updated)

### Source Code Files
- `client/src/App.tsx` (import fixes)
- `client/src/index.tsx` (import fixes)
- `client/src/pages/Admin/Dashboard.tsx` (duplicate function removal)
- `client/src/pages/Terminal/Terminal.tsx` (type safety fixes)
